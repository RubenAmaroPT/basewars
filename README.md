# BaseWars
Open-source version of basewars, you need to be (or have) a developer to use this, it's a bit broken but in a lot better condition than the other public versions!

### You can get a copy of our private version along with support on [ScriptFodder](https://scriptfodder.com/scripts/view/3309) but that version is not open-source.
#### Pull requests and issues for fixes are welcome and will be approved, but attempting to merge the private version or add content will not be.
